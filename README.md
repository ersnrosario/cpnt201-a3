# Journal Entry

Today I woke up at 5:00am

I went for lunch and walked the dog.

I woke up at 7:30am and prepared for class.

After class I'm now working on the assignment in lab time.

I will be working with my team members for our final project.

That's it for my journal entry. 

Maybe there will be a merge conflict.
